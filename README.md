# AdBlockFilters
My adblock filters made for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets)

## [EasyDutch](https://github.com/BPower0036/AdBlockFilters/tree/main/EasyDutch)
My own updated version of EasyList Dutch special for uBlock Origin, so I use only the uBlock syntax. 

It's now the standard Dutch list in uBlock Origin, see [this](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/commit/1fc3b57ba5dafcf9283eef4274043446207da9df)

I made this filter because the EasyList Dutch filter isn't maintained often.
So I made this to provide you a better service!!

If you see ads on dutch websites please [report](https://github.com/BPower0036/AdBlockFilters/issues) it to me or sent me a email to easydutch.adblock@gmail.com. For contributing see: [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/BPower0036/AdBlockFilters/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## [Dynamic Rules](https://github.com/BPower0036/AdBlockFilters/blob/main/dynamic%20rules)
A whitelist for medium mode of uBlock Origin when only blocking 3p-frames.

It can recommended to use EasyDutch with the default filterlists in [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets) and with this list.
