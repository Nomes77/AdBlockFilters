# AdBlockFilters
Adblock filters made for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets)

## [EasyDutch](https://github.com/BPower0036/AdBlockFilters/tree/main/EasyDutch)
My own updated version of EasyList Dutch special for uBlock Origin, so I use only the uBlock syntax. 

I made this filter because the EasyList Dutch filter isn't maintained often. <br>
So I made this to provide you a better service!! <br>
This list also handles anti-adblock, which isn't done by EasyList Dutch. See this [PR comment](https://github.com/easylist/easylistdutch/issues/11#issuecomment-818864565) for more information.

If you see ads on dutch websites please [report](https://github.com/BPower0036/AdBlockFilters/issues) it to me or sent me an email to easydutch.adblock@gmail.com <br>

## [Dynamic Rules](https://github.com/BPower0036/AdBlockFilters/blob/main/dynamic%20rules)
A whitelist for medium mode of uBlock Origin when only blocking 3p-frames.

I recommend to use EasyDutch with the default filterlists in [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets) and with this list.
