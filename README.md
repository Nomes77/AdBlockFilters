# AdBlockFilters
My adblock filters made for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets)

## [EasyDutch](https://github.com/BPower0036/AdBlockFilters/blob/main/easydutch)
My own updated version of EasyList Dutch

I made this filter because the EasyList Dutch filter isn't maintained often.
So I made this to provide you a better service!!

If you see ads on dutch websites please [report](https://github.com/BPower0036/AdBlockFilters/issues) it to me.
##### IMPORTANT
If a filterrule uses the specific uBlock syntax and it is already in 'uBlock Filter' I am for now not going to add it, because of unnecessary duplicate lines.  

## [Dynamic Rules](https://github.com/BPower0036/AdBlockFilters/blob/main/dynamic%20rules)
A whitelist for medium mode of uBlock Origin when only blocking 3p-frames.

It can recommended to use EasyDutch with the default filterlists in [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets) and with this list.
