# AdBlockFilters
My adblock filters made for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets)

## [Dynamic Rules](https://github.com/BPower0036/AdBlockFilters/blob/main/dynamic%20rules)
A whitelist for medium mode of uBlock Origin when only blocking 3p-frames

## [EasyDutch](https://github.com/BPower0036/AdBlockFilters/blob/main/easydutch)
My own update version of EasyList Dutch

I made this filter because the EasyList Dutch filter isn't maintained often.
So I made this to provide you a better service!!

It is recommended to use this filter list with the default filterlists in [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets) and with the above mentioned rules for blocking 3p-frames.

If you see ads on dutch websites please report it to me.
