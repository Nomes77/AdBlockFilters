## Specific-General Hide
You can use this filter if you have enabled `Ignore general cosmetic filters` in uBlock Origin but still want some general hiding elements to be used. <br>
For this list I have used the default uBlock Filters and [EasyList (Optimized)](https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/ublock/filters/101_optimized.txt). 

### What I have done
1. Changed `##` from those lists to `*##`
2. I deleted every unblocking general hiding element from the results I got after I applied the first step

### Why
This list and enabling `Ignore general cosmetic filters` will save you around 11,000 cosmetic filters.
This can be handy especially if you are low on resources or want a little bit faster page loading.

***
My goal is to update this list once a month, maybe twice or even maybe every week.
